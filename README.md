# notesTool

## Description

**notesTool** is a command-line tool(written in golang) that allows users to manage short single-line notes. Using this application, users can create collections of notes, open and view them, add new notes, or remove existing notes. The tool takes exactly one argument, which is the name of the collection.

## Notes

**The Notes** file is created in JSON type. **JSON** is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax. JSON exists as a string â€” useful when you want to transmit data across a network. In this case JSON string can be stored in its own file, which is basically just a text file with an extension of ```.json```.

### **When starting the program in terminal, you can create a new notes collection by adding to the command collection its name,if the collection already exists it just opens it and user interacts with it**:

```
go run notestool.go newcollection 
```
Then the **programm starts** and the collection is created, then user can interact with it by choosing the menu options.

If no argument is provided, the number of arguments is not one, or if the argument is help, the tool will display a brief help message that explains how to use the application.

```
$ ./notestool
Usage: ./todotool [TAG]
```
